## Pirate's Treasure

My pirate friend told me "Thar's buried booty hidden in this [zip file](treasure.zip)!" Could you help find it for him?

## Mystery of the French

"J'ai caché quelque chose de secret à travers mes mystérieuses manières françaises", exclaimed my French enemy. (For those of you who don't speak French, that means "I have hidden something secret through my mysterious french ways!") He told me `glga{w4vk3_fm3u}` (he can pronounce that) and told me the key is `BAGUETTE`. Can you figure it out?

## School Employee

An employee of the school scoffed at me while I struggle to open the locked door of a classroom. He did give me the key, though: `fake`. See if you can figure out how to unlock this [lock](flag_but_confusing.txt).
